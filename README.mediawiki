== PlayBingo ==
This contains my prototype for evaluating the play framework version 1.2.4.
It is not for productional use and no best practice example.

It is a bingo game with a chat.

== Highlights ==
* tests for a registration flow (registration, email confirmation, login, logout, forgot password with captcha)
* tests for Java Script running with play autotest
* graceful websockets
* tests works with localized version
* tests for AJAX

== Things that could be better ==
* the play provided password hashes are not safe: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/play-framework/9KIUwWBjudQ/discussion
* Cross-Site Request Forgery: http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2/security
* the websockets version of the current Chrome browser does not work with play 1.2.4 anymore, so you must run it with play 1.2.5
* chat does not use websockets, but the bingo game does
* jackson is better for generating json than gson
* there are better libs available than graceful websockets
